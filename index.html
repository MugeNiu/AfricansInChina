				The growing prescence of Africans in Guangzhou, the third largest city in China,is the flip side of China's influence in Africa and a reflection of increasing ties between the two regions. African students coming on government scholarships and traders looking for cheap goods to sell back to their home country flock to the area called "Xiaobeilu" (Little North Road) or known among locals as the "Little Africa" or "Chocolate City".

					<p> Mark moved from his home country Kenya to Guangzhou to pursue a degree in international business. The Chinese government promised to give 18,000 scholarships to students like Mark between 2013 and 2015, many of whom are studying business-related subjects. Obtaining the Chinese work visa is a long and arduous process for foreigners and many internaitonal students are forced to leave or overstay their visas after graduation. </p>

					<p> Three times a year, Sam Bimba comes to buy clothing in Guangzhou to sell back to Liberia. On his business trips, he likes to spend time in the neighborhood of Xiaobeilu, where an active African business community gathers. Each time he can only spend up to 30 days in the country before his visa expires, but Sam said he understands foreigners need to respect the laws and regulations of the land. </p>
